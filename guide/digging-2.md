# Digging and Mining (Page 2)

## Actually Digging

The button to dig or mine is located in the third section.
- The tool used for digging depends on the target block at hand:
  - You use shovels (or bare hands) to dig dirt, worms, and miscellaneous items.
  - You **need** a pickaxe to mine ores.
- The section itself shows the **current block** you are digging and its **HP (<:h:1142106667601903858>)**.
- Depending on your shovel, you deal a certain amount of HP to the block per hit.
- When the HP of the block reaches 0, you clear the block and the dirt/item is added to your backpack.
- **Click the button labeled "Dig..." or "Mine..." to dig!**
- **You MUST surface after digging to transfer your items to your inventory!** \

## As you progress...

- **You can upgrade your backpack.** Use the {{/backpacks}} command to view and manage your backpacks. \
You can upgrade to better backpacks with greater capacities!
- **Craft and discover better tools.** The {{/craft}} command can be used to craft a variety of items in Coined, \
including stronger shovels and pickaxes that deal more HP to blocks! See *Crafting Items* for more information on \
crafting in general.
- **Buy and utilize power-ups.** We went over the <:railgun:1376071981719359518> **Railgun** on the previous slide.
- **Equip pets and use their abilities.** Some pets give passive and/or active boosts when digging. See *Pets* for \
more information on pets in general.
