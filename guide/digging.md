# Digging & Mining

Simulate a digging session, which is a pure profit system where you can collect coins and items. Use the {{/dig}} command to start digging.

## Tools

To enhance your digging, there are several tools you can own before you start:
- <:shovel:1376356818258759751> **Shovel**  ‚Äî Allows you to dig dirt twice as fast.

-# Each of these tools can be obtained from the {{/shop}}!

## The Digging Interface

You might be bombarded with a ton of information and buttons, but don't fret‚Äîhere is a quick overview of the digging interface:
- The first section details your **stamina** (‚ö°Ô∏è) and **backpack** (üéí) status.
  - **Stamina** is used to limit the amount of digging you can do in a session. \
By default, you start with 100 stamina, and each "digging action" uses 1 stamina.
  - Dirt and items collected along the way will be stored in your **backpack** (*not* permanent inventory!). \
Your backpack has a limited capacity, which is upgradable.
- The second section is a visualization of your digging plus three **navigation buttons**:
  - ‚¨ÖÔ∏è (left) ‚Äî Focus on the block to your left, or move to the left
  - ‚è¨ (down) ‚Äî Focus on the block below you
  - ‚û°Ô∏è (right) ‚Äî Focus on the block to your right, or move to the right
- The third section is where you view the target block and perform digging (*see the next page*)
- Finally, press **Surface** to end your digging session and transfer all collected items to your inventory.
