-# Spin the Wheel, Quest Rerolls, and Mythic Pets

### Spin the Wheel
- Added `/spin-the-wheel`, where you can occasionally "spin the wheel" for a chance at one of eight prizes
  - You get one free spin every 6 hours (+1 more free spin if you `/vote`)!
  - Similarly, the eight prizes on the wheel will refresh every 6 hours
  - Super rare items such as the <:plasma_shovel:1376356902425989160> **Plasma Shovel** and <:mythic_crate:1379661152333725807> **Mythic Crates** can occasionally spawn as potential prizes. 

### Quest improvements
- Add `/quests daily` as a shortcut to view daily quests
- Add quest rerolls 
  - You get up to 5 individiual quest rerolls per week (they reset Monday 00:00 UTC)
