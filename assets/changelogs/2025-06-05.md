-# Quests, Quest Pass, and Pet UI changes

## Quests and Quest Pass
- Coined now has a quests system! For now, there is a voting quest + 3 recurring quest slots + 2 daily quest slots
  - To see your quests, see `/quests view`
- Upon completeing quests, you get quest :tickets: Tickets which are used towards upgrading your **quest pass**
  - You can view your quest pass by running `/quests pass`
  - Your quest pass begins at **tier 0**. When you advance to higher tiers by obtaining :tickets:, you will receive rewards which are listed in the `/quests pass` command
  - The quest pass is seasonal. This means that your tickets reset every season. The current season will last an indefinite amount of time, though (probably when enough users obtain tier 30) 

### Other Updates
- Revamp the `/pets all` UI (see the above image)
  - Also slightly revamp the `/pets view` UI
- Railgun/work/vote/alcohol/cigarette cooldowns now show in `/cooldowns list`
- Migrate all emojis to application emojis (this is more of an internal change)
  - Users without Nitro should see emojis render properly in private messages now
