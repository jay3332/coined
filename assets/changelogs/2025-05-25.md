-# New pets, jobs, and leaderboard improvements

## Pets Updates
- Revamped view for pets (`.pets`)
- Add the following pets:
  - **:turtle: Turtle**
  - <:weasel:1376726983836438588> **Weasel** (uncommon)
  - <:armadillo:1376727000873566228> **Armadillo** (rare)
  - :fox: **Fox** (epic)
  - <:jaguar:1376727015591510067> **Jaguar** (epic)
  - <:tiger:1376727023820472330> **Tiger** (legendary)
- Add <:golden_net:1376754300440678481> **Golden Net** (craft only)
- Balance out chances of obtaining pets
  - **Without Net:** nothing: 20% | common: 68% | uncommon: 7% | rare: 4% | epic: 0.8% | legendary: 0.18%
  - **With Net:** nothing: 12% | common: 67% | uncommon: 12% | rare: 6% | epic: 2% | legendary: 0.8%

## Work Updates
- Added five new jobs: **Barista, Librarian, Technician, Chef, and Nurse**
  - The latter four jobs require **intelligence**, which as of now you can only earn by answering trivia correctly (.trivia)
    - Note: in the future, training skills (.train) and probably some other commands will also give IQ
  - Job shift requirements and salaries have also been balanced
- New minigame for working: Emoji Algebra
- You can now earn XP from working

## Better `.leaderboard`
- Improved the `leaderboard` command 
  - You can now sort by wallet, bank, total coins, and level (`.lb bank`, `.lb total`, `.lb lvl`, etc.)
  - You can now also view the global leaderboard (`.lb --global`, `.lb total --global`, etc.)
  - Abiding by the privacy policy, there is now a setting to hide your username from the global leaderboard (`anonymous`)
    - When enabled (`.settings anon true`), your username will show as "Anonymous" to others (but not you)

## Other Adjustments
- Added 25% XP multiplier if you use Coined in a server with 50+ members
- Add an indicator and shortcut to `.level` to view multipliers
- Introduce rarity emojis in `pets view`/`pets all`
- Internal performance improvements regarding level calculations
### Just so you know...
- Poker (`.poker`) was added in July 2024
- Top.gg voting rewards (`.vote`) have been fixed
