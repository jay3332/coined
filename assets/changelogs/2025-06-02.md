-# Digging Improvements + Level Rewards + June Voting/Digging Event

### Digging Improvements
- Added **<:dynamite:1377482796255154246> Dynamite**, which deals some HP to surrounding blocks
  - Not directly buyable, but can be earned through beg/search/crime and crates (all crates have a chance at giving dynamite)
- You now get 20 extra stamina per prestige (e.g. prestige 1 = 120 stamina, prestige 2 = 140 stamina, etc.)
- Reduce price of Railgun from 200,000 -> 50,000
- Begin tracking digging statistics (the "deepest dig" statistic will count starting from today)
  - If you want to count an old digging session towards your deepest dig then ping me in the [support server](https://discord.gg/BjzrQZjFwk) w/ screenshot + channel/message ID

  - **For existing players:** you will receive all missed level rewards at once on your next level up
